# ROADMAP

The goal of this project is to achieve:

- a smooth testing flow
- quick test runs
- being a reliable tool

v1.0.0

- [ ] Smooth feedback when there is a compilation error
- [x] Compile with nvim-jdtls when available
- [ ] Select and run certain testcases of parameterized tests
- [ ] Integrate with [nvim-coverage](https://github.com/andythigpen/nvim-coverage)

extra:

- [ ] for maintainers: add luacov -> add more tests -> merciless refactor
- [ ] compatibility with the Java Platform Module System (eclipse jdtls limitation)
